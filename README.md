## app.R
I created a shinyapp in R to predict the mean ozone (ppb) in New York using maximum daily temperature(degrees F) and average wind speed(mph). This air quality data was obtained from the New York State Depatment of Conservation (ozone data) and the National Weather Service (meteorological data). To use the app, select a prediction model (either Temperature or Wind Speed). Once you have chosen a prediction model, choose your desired value from the sliders. For temperature, you will be choosing a temperature between 50 and 110 degrees fahrenheit. For wind speed, you will be choosing a wind speed between 0 and 15 mph. The app will then show an appropriate plot with the corresponding linear model. Model 1 shows the predicted mean ozone based on temperature and model 2 shows the predicted mean ozone based on wind speed. Overall, this app will predict the ozone quality based on your choice.

## Water Analysis.rmd
I worked with Dr. Slivovsky at California Polytechnic State University- San Luis Obispo to characterize the effects of using a smart home- wide water monitor in hopes of reducing water usage. I did this by comparing the water usage in households in 2018 and in 2019 to see if the monitor helped reduce water usage.
